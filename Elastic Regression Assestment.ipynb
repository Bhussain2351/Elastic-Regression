What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans. Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression technique that combines two regularization methods: Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regression. It was developed to address some limitations of both methods when applied individually.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans. Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression involves selecting the mixing parameter (\n�\nα) and the regularization strength (\n�\nλ). This process is typically done using cross-validation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ans. \nAdvantages of Elastic Net Regression\nHandles Multicollinearity:\n\nUnlike Lasso, Elastic Net can handle highly correlated predictors effectively by selecting groups of correlated features instead of arbitrarily dropping some.\nCombines L1 and L2 Regularization:\n\nIt benefits from both:\nL1 (Lasso): For feature selection and sparsity.\nL2 (Ridge): For stability and handling multicollinearity.\nFeature Selection:\n\nSimilar to Lasso, Elastic Net can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting the most important features.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q4.

Interpreting coefficients in Elastic Net Regression requires understanding how the regularization terms affect the model and what the coefficients represent.","metadata":{}}]}
